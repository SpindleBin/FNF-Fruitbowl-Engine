#  Fruitbowl Engine
Fruitbowl Engine is a Friday Night Funkin' Engine created for modifications to be made with Lua.

THIS SHITS A WORK IN PROGRESS!!!

Please open source any modifications you make! Not doing so is not cool, especially since malware can always be passed around in hardcoded mods!

### How do I use the engine?
To be written!

### Can I contribute to the Engine?
Hell yeah you can!

## Support
Discord Server coming soon!

## Q & A
### Looks like a lot's already done, what's up with that?
Fruitbowl Engine is made with an old FNF Engine I made called Papaya Engine. Papaya Engine was created for the KAVIFUNK Mod before I finished the Engine and scrapped it.
KAVIFUNK will likely still be using Papaya Engine.
